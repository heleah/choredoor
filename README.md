Interactive [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/web-development/tracks/build-interactive-websites/modules/web-dev-interactive-websites/projects/chore-door "Chore Door") Game Project

In this game, you have to open all doors before the little _Chore Bot_ comes out to distract you from all the fun. If he finds you before all the doors are open, you lose the current round. Two counters show your current as well as your best winning streak.
